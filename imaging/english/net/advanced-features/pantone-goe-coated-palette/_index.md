This powerful library provides you with the tools you need to manipulate and create images with ease. 

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Imaging for .NET: To follow along, you need to have Aspose.Imaging for .NET installed. If you haven't already, you can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/).

2. Sample Image: Prepare a sample image file in CDR format that you want to work with in this tutorial.

Now, let's jump into the exciting world of Pantone Goe Coated Palette.

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary Namespaces to get started. Open your Visual Studio project and make sure to add references to Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.Examples.CSharp;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Cdr;

## Step 1: Load the CDR Image

Begin by loading the CDR image using Aspose.Imaging. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your image file.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string inputFileName = dataDir + "test2.cdr";
using (var image = (CdrImage)Image.Load(inputFileName))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

## Step 2: Perform Image Manipulation

Now, let's perform some image manipulation. In this example, we'll save the CDR image as a PNG with specific options.

```csharp
image.Save(Path.Combine(dataDir, "result.png"), new PngOptions()
{
    VectorRasterizationOptions = new CdrRasterizationOptions
    {
        Positioning = PositioningTypes.Relative
    }
});
```

## Step 3: Clean Up

After you have successfully manipulated the image, it's good practice to clean up any temporary files.

```csharp
File.Delete(dataDir + "result.png");
```
