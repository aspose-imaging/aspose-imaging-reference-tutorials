# Convert APS to PSD with Aspose.Imaging for .NET

Are you looking to effortlessly convert APS files to PSD format while preserving vector properties? Aspose.Imaging for .NET is here to simplify your task. In this step-by-step guide, we will show you how to achieve this conversion. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Imaging for .NET Library: You need to download and install the Aspose.Imaging library for .NET. You can obtain it from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/).

2. Your Document Directory: Ensure you have the path to your document directory ready. This is where the APS file is located.

3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is essential to implement the conversion process.

## Import Namespaces

Let's start by importing the necessary Namespaces to work with Aspose.Imaging for .NET. Ensure that you've added the reference to the Aspose.Imaging library in your project.

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;
using Aspose.Imaging.Vectorization;
```

## Step 1: Load the APS File

Begin by loading the APS file you want to convert to PSD. You will also specify the path to the document directory where the APS file is located.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string inputFileName = dataDir + "SimpleShapes.cdr";

using (Image image = Image.Load(inputFileName))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```

## Step 2: Configure Conversion Options

In this step, you need to set up the conversion options for exporting the APS file to PSD format. Aspose.Imaging provides various options for vector image conversion.

```csharp
PsdOptions imageOptions = new PsdOptions()
{
    VectorRasterizationOptions = new VectorRasterizationOptions(),
    VectorizationOptions = new PsdVectorizationOptions()
    {
        VectorDataCompositionMode = VectorDataCompositionMode.SeparateLayers
    }
};

imageOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions.PageWidth = image.Width;
imageOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions.PageHeight = image.Height;
```

## Step 3: Save the PSD File

Now, it's time to save the converted PSD file to your desired location.

```csharp
image.Save(dataDir + "result.psd", imageOptions);
```

## Step 4: Clean Up

After the conversion is complete, you may want to delete the temporary PSD file that was created during the process.

```csharp
File.Delete(dataDir + "result.psd");
```

## Conclusion

Converting APS to PSD format with Aspose.Imaging for .NET is straightforward and efficient. This powerful library allows you to maintain vector properties during the conversion, making it a valuable tool for graphic designers and developers alike.
