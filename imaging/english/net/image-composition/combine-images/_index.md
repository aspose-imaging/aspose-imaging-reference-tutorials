# Combine Images with Aspose.Imaging for .NET

In today's digital age, image processing and manipulation are integral to many applications, from web development to graphic design. Aspose.Imaging for .NET is a powerful library that empowers .NET developers to perform a wide range of image operations. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to combine images using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the details, you'll need to have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your system. Aspose.Imaging for .NET is best utilized within this integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Aspose.Imaging for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Imaging for .NET from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/). You can obtain a free trial or purchase a license for full access to the library.

3. Image Files: Prepare the image files you intend to combine. Place them in a directory accessible to your application.

## Import Namespaces

In your Visual Studio project, you need to import the Aspose.Imaging for .NET package. To do this, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open Visual Studio

Launch Visual Studio and open your project or create a new one if you haven't already.

### Step 2: Add a Reference

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Add" -> "Reference."

### Step 3: Add Aspose.Imaging Reference

1. In the Reference Manager, click "Browse."
2. Browse to the location where you installed Aspose.Imaging for .NET.
3. Select the Aspose.Imaging DLL and click "Add."

### Step 4: Using Statement

In your code file, add the following using statement to include the Aspose.Imaging namespace:

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
```

Now that you have imported the necessary Namespaces, you're ready to combine images in Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

## Combining Images - Step by Step

To combine images, you can follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Create a New Project

Create a new project or open an existing one in Visual Studio.

### Step 2: Set the Data Directory

Define the data directory where your image files are located. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your image files:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

### Step 3: Initialize Image Options

Create an instance of `JpegOptions` to set various properties:

```csharp
JpegOptions imageOptions = new JpegOptions();
```

### Step 4: Specify the Output Image

Create an instance of `FileCreateSource` and assign it to the `Source` property of your `imageOptions`. This step defines the name and format of the output image:

```csharp
imageOptions.Source = new FileCreateSource(dataDir + "Two_images_result_out.bmp", false);
```

### Step 5: Create a New Image

Create an instance of `Image` and define the canvas size. The following code creates an image with a canvas size of 600x600:

```csharp
using (var image = Image.Create(imageOptions, 600, 600))
```

### Step 6: Add Images to the Canvas

Use the `Graphics` class to add and position the images on the canvas. The `DrawImage` method allows you to specify the image file, position, and dimensions for each image you want to combine:

```csharp
var graphics = new Graphics(image);
graphics.Clear(Color.White); // Clear the canvas with a white background.
graphics.DrawImage(Image.Load(dataDir + "sample_1.bmp"), 0, 0, 600, 300); // First image.
graphics.DrawImage(Image.Load(dataDir + "File1.bmp"), 0, 300, 600, 300);    // Second image.
```

### Step 7: Save the Combined Image

Finally, save the combined image:

```csharp
image.Save();
```
