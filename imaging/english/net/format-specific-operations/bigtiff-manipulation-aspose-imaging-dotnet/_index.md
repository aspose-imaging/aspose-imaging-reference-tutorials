Once you have the library set up, initialize it by configuring your project with appropriate namespaces and settings.

## Implementation Guide

### Loading a BigTIFF Image

The first step is to load your BigTIFF file into your application. Hereâ€™s how:

#### 1. Define File Paths
Set up your input and output directories using placeholders for flexibility:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your document directory path
string fileName = "input-BigTiff.tif";
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine(dataDir, fileName);
```

#### 2. Load the Image
Use Aspose.Imaging to load and cast the image as a `BigTiffImage`:
```csharp
using (var image = Image.Load(inputFilePath) as BigTiffImage)
{
    // Proceed with modifications here
}
```
This step ensures your application can efficiently handle large TIFF files.

### Saving and Converting the Format

After loading, you may want to modify or save it in a different format. Here's how:

#### 3. Save the Image
Specify output options using `BigTiffOptions` to convert the image:
```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\
