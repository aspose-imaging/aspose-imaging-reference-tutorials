## Implementation Guide

### Load GIF Image

Follow these steps to load a GIF image using Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Environment

Ensure your project references Aspose.Imaging and includes necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Gif;
```

#### Step 2: Load the GIF Image

Here's how you can load a GIF image into memory:

```csharp
string dataDir = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "your-image.gif");

// Load the GIF file
using (GifImage gifImage = (GifImage)Image.Load(dataDir))
{
    // Access and manipulate the loaded image as needed
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `dataDir` represents the path to your GIF file.
- The `GifImage` class provides methods specific to GIF files, such as frame manipulation.

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Frames

To work with individual frames of a GIF:

```csharp
foreach (var frame in gifImage.Frames)
{
    // Process each frame
}
```

**Parameters and Return Values:**
- `Frames` is a collection that allows access to each frame within the GIF.

### Practical Applications
