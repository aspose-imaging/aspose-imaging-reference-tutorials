# Rotate DICOM Images with Aspose.Imaging for .NET

## Introduction

In today's digital age, image processing has become an integral part of various industries, from healthcare to design and beyond. If you're a .NET developer looking to manipulate and enhance medical images, Aspose.Imaging for .NET is a powerful tool at your disposal. In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of rotating a DICOM image using Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey into the world of image processing, this tutorial will provide you with clear, step-by-step instructions to ensure you can successfully rotate DICOM images and integrate this functionality into your .NET applications. Let's dive right in!

## Prerequisites

Before we delve into the exciting world of rotating DICOM images using Aspose.Imaging for .NET, it's essential to have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Environment Setup: Make sure you have a working development environment with Visual Studio and .NET Framework installed.

2. Aspose.Imaging for .NET Library: Download and install Aspose.Imaging for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/).

3. DICOM Image: You'll need a DICOM image file to work with. If you don't have one, you can find sample DICOM images online or use your own.

4. Basic C# Knowledge: A fundamental understanding of C# is required to follow this tutorial.

Now that we've covered the prerequisites, let's proceed with importing the necessary namespaces to get started with DICOM image rotation.

## Import Namespaces

First, we need to import the relevant namespaces to access the Aspose.Imaging for .NET library and work with DICOM images. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Dicom;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps in a step-by-step guide format to make the process of rotating a DICOM image more manageable.

## Step 1: Load the DICOM Image

Begin by loading the DICOM image you want to rotate. This is typically achieved by reading the image from a file. In this example, we're using a file stream:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (var fileStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "file.dcm", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
{
    using (DicomImage image = new DicomImage(fileStream))
    {
        // Your code goes here
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Rotate the DICOM Image

Now comes the exciting part â€“ rotating the DICOM image. In this example, we're rotating the image by 10 degrees, but you can adjust the angle to your specific requirements:

```csharp
image.Rotate(10);
```

## Step 3: Save the Rotated Image

After the rotation is complete, it's essential to save the rotated DICOM image. We'll save it as a BMP file:

```csharp
image.Save(dataDir + "RotatingDICOMImage_out.bmp", new BmpOptions());
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully rotated a DICOM image using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. This powerful library enables you to manipulate medical images with ease, opening up possibilities for various applications in healthcare and beyond. With the steps provided in this guide, you can now integrate image rotation into your .NET projects seamlessly.
