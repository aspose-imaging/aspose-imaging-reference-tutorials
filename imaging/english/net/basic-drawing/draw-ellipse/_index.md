# Drawing Ellipses in Aspose.Imaging for .NET

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of drawing ellipses using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. Aspose.Imaging is a powerful library that allows you to manipulate and create images in various formats within your .NET applications. We'll start by introducing the concept and prerequisites, then break down each example into multiple steps to ensure a clear understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into drawing ellipses in Aspose.Imaging for .NET, you should ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system for .NET development.

2. Aspose.Imaging for .NET: You must have Aspose.Imaging for .NET installed. If not, you can download it from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/).

3. Your Document Directory: Create a directory where you will save the images created during this tutorial.

Now that we have the prerequisites in place, let's get started.

## Import Namespaces

In this step, we will import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Imaging. Follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Open Your Visual Studio Project

Launch Visual Studio and open your .NET project where you plan to use Aspose.Imaging.

### Step 2: Add Using Directives

In your code file, add the following using directives to include the required namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.Brushes;
using Aspose.Imaging.Colors;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Bmp;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Bmp.Options;
using Aspose.Imaging.Sources;
```

Now that you've imported the necessary namespaces, you're ready to draw an ellipse.

## Drawing Ellipse

We'll now provide a step-by-step guide on how to draw an ellipse using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. This example will guide you through the process.

### Step 1: Set Up the Output File

Before drawing an ellipse, you need to set up the output file. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(dataDir + "DrawingEllipse_out.bmp", FileMode.Create))
{
```

In this code snippet, we create a FileStream to specify the output file path.

### Step 2: Configure BmpOptions

To configure the BMP format and other properties, use the following code:

```csharp
BmpOptions saveOptions = new BmpOptions();
saveOptions.BitsPerPixel = 32;
saveOptions.Source = new StreamSource(stream);
```

Here, we create a BmpOptions instance, set the bit depth, and specify the source stream.

### Step 3: Create an Image

Create an instance of the `Image` class with the specified options and dimensions:

```csharp
using (Image image = Image.Create(saveOptions, 100, 100))
{
```

In this step, we create an image with a size of 100x100 pixels.

### Step 4: Initialize Graphics and Clear Surface

Initialize a Graphics instance and clear the image surface:

```csharp
Graphics graphic = new Graphics(image);
graphic.Clear(Color.Yellow);
```

This code creates a Graphics object and clears the image with a yellow background.

### Step 5: Draw Ellipses

Now, let's draw ellipses on the image:

```csharp
graphic.DrawEllipse(new Pen(Color.Red), new Rectangle(30, 10, 40, 80));
graphic.DrawEllipse(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.Blue)), new Rectangle(10, 30, 80, 40));
```

Here, we draw a red dotted ellipse and a blue solid ellipse on the image.

### Step 6: Save the Image

Finally, save the image:

```csharp
image.Save();
```

## Conclusion

Drawing ellipses in Aspose.Imaging for .NET is a straightforward process. With the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can easily create and manipulate images in your .NET applications. Aspose.Imaging provides a wide range of image editing capabilities, making it a valuable tool for developers.
