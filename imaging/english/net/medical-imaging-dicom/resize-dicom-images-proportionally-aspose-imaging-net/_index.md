# Proportional DICOM Image Resizing with Aspose.Imaging for .NET: A Complete Guide

## Introduction
In the realm of medical imaging, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images are crucial for diagnosis and analysis. However, these high-resolution files can be cumbersome when it comes to storage or transmission. This tutorial will guide you through resizing DICOM images proportionally using Aspose.Imaging for .NET—a versatile library that simplifies image processing tasks.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Installing and setting up Aspose.Imaging for .NET
- Resizing DICOM images by height and width while maintaining proportions
- Practical applications of these techniques in medical imaging workflows

Let's dive into how you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your projects. Before we begin, let’s ensure you have everything needed to follow along.

## Prerequisites
Before starting with Aspose.Imaging for .NET, make sure you have the following prerequisites covered:

1. **Required Libraries and Versions:**
   - You'll need Aspose.Imaging for .NET library.
   - Ensure your project targets a compatible version of .NET framework (e.g., .NET Core 3.1 or later).

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - A C# development environment like Visual Studio.

3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with image processing concepts.

## Setting Up Aspose.Imaging for .NET
To get started, you need to install the Aspose.Imaging library in your project. Here are the installation steps using different package managers:

**.NET CLI:**
```shell
dotnet add package Aspose.Imaging
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```shell
Install-Package Aspose.Imaging
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "Aspose.Imaging" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To unlock all features of Aspose.Imaging, you might need to acquire a license. Here’s how:

- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license from [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for extended access during development.
- **Purchase:** If satisfied, purchase a full license at [this link](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

Once installed, initialize the library by referencing it in your project files.

## Implementation Guide
Let’s break down how to implement DICOM image resizing proportionally using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. We’ll cover both height and width adjustments with detailed explanations.

### Resizing DICOM Image Proportionally by Height
This section will demonstrate resizing a DICOM image based on its height, ensuring the aspect ratio is preserved.

#### Overview
Proportional resizing by height maintains the original aspect ratio while adjusting the image’s height to a specified size—ideal for maintaining visual integrity across different display formats.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Load the DICOM Image**
First, open and load your DICOM file using Aspose.Imaging's `DicomImage` class.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Dicom;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Open a DICOM file for reading
using (var fileStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "/file.dcm\
