# Converting DJVU to PDF with Aspose.Imaging for .NET

In today's digital age, converting file formats has become a common need for many professionals and individuals. Aspose.Imaging for .NET provides a powerful toolset to help you work with various image formats. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting DJVU files to PDF using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and steps to perform this conversion effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Imaging for .NET: You must have the Aspose.Imaging library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.Imaging for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/).

2. Sample DJVU File: Prepare a sample DJVU file that you want to convert to PDF.

With these prerequisites met, you're ready to get started.

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

In this section, we'll import the necessary namespaces required for the conversion process. These namespaces are essential for accessing the functionality of Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Djvu;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;
using Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage;
```

Now that you've imported the required namespaces, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps for a comprehensive guide.

## Step 1: Load the DJVU Image

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load a DjVu image
using (DjvuImage image = (DjvuImage)Image.Load(dataDir + "Sample.djvu"))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

Here, you need to specify the path to your DJVU file. Aspose.Imaging loads the DJVU image for further processing.

## Step 2: Initialize PDF Export Options

```csharp
// Create an instance of PdfOptions and Initialize the metadata for Pdf document
PdfOptions exportOptions = new PdfOptions();
exportOptions.PdfDocumentInfo = new PdfDocumentInfo();
```

This step involves initializing the PDF export options and setting PDF document information such as title, author, and other metadata.

## Step 3: Specify Pages to Export

```csharp
// Create an instance of IntRange and initialize it with the range of DjVu pages to be exported
IntRange range = new IntRange(0, 5); // Export first 5 pages
```

Specify the range of DJVU pages you want to export to PDF. In this example, we export the first 5 pages. Adjust the range as needed.

## Step 4: Perform the Conversion

```csharp
// Initialize an instance of DjvuMultiPageOptions with the range of DjVu pages to be exported and Save the result in PDF format
exportOptions.MultiPageOptions = new DjvuMultiPageOptions(range);
image.Save(dataDir + "ConvertDjVuToPDFFormat_out.pdf", exportOptions);
```

With all the settings in place, this final step involves converting the DJVU file to PDF format. The resulting PDF file will be saved to the specified directory.
