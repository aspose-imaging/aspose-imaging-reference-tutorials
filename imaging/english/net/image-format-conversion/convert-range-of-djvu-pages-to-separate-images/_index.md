# Convert Range of DJVU Pages to Separate Images in Aspose.Imaging for .NET

If you're looking for a powerful .NET library to handle image conversion and manipulation tasks, Aspose.Imaging for .NET is the perfect choice. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting a range of DJVU pages into separate images using Aspose.Imaging. You'll find step-by-step instructions and code snippets to help you achieve this task.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Imaging for .NET Library

You'll need to have Aspose.Imaging for .NET installed. If you haven't already, you can download it from the [Aspose.Imaging for .NET page](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/).

2. Development Environment

To follow along, you should have a development environment set up with Visual Studio or any other .NET IDE.

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

First, you need to include the required namespaces in your code to work with Aspose.Imaging. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Djvu;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Djvu.Options;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;
using Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage;
```

## Converting DJVU Pages

Now, let's break down the process of converting a range of DJVU pages into separate images using Aspose.Imaging for .NET into a series of easy-to-follow steps.

### Step 1: Load the DJVU Image

To start, you should load the DJVU image that you want to convert. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your DJVU file.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load a DjVu image
using (DjvuImage image = (DjvuImage)Image.Load(dataDir + "Sample.djvu"))
{
    // Your code for further processing will go here.
}
```

### Step 2: Set Export Options

Now, create an instance of `BmpOptions` and configure the desired options for the resultant images. In this example, we set the `BitsPerPixel` to 32.

```csharp
BmpOptions exportOptions = new BmpOptions();
exportOptions.BitsPerPixel = 32;
```

### Step 3: Define the Range of Pages

To specify the range of pages you want to export, create an instance of `IntRange` and initialize it with the page range. In this case, we export pages 0 to 2.

```csharp
IntRange range = new IntRange(0, 2);
```

### Step 4: Loop through the Pages

Now, loop through the pages within the specified range and save each page as a separate BMP image. DJVU files do not support layering, so we save each page individually.

```csharp
int counter = 0;
foreach (var i in range.Range)
{
    exportOptions.MultiPageOptions = new DjvuMultiPageOptions(range.GetArrayOneItemFromIndex(counter));
    image.Save(dataDir + string.Format("{0}_out.bmp", counter++), exportOptions);
}
```

And that's it! You've successfully converted a range of DJVU pages into separate images using Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

## Conclusion

Aspose.Imaging for .NET simplifies image conversion tasks, making it an excellent choice for developers. In this tutorial, we walked you through the process of converting DJVU pages to separate images step by step. With the right code and library at your disposal, image conversion becomes a breeze.
