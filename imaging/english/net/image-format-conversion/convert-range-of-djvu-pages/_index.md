If you're looking to convert a range of DJVU pages into another format, Aspose.Imaging for .NET is the perfect tool for the job. In this step-by-step guide, we'll show you how to perform this task efficiently. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to the world of Aspose.Imaging, we'll break down the process for you. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A working knowledge of C# and the .NET framework.
- Visual Studio or any preferred C# development environment.
- The Aspose.Imaging for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/).
- A DJVU image file that you want to convert.
- A destination folder for saving the converted file.

Now that you have everything set up, let's begin the step-by-step guide to converting DJVU pages.

## Importing Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.Imaging. Add the following lines of code at the beginning of your C# file:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Djvu;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Tiff;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;
using Aspose.Imaging.Multithreading;
```

These namespaces allow you to work with DJVU and TIFF file formats and access the required classes and methods for the conversion process.

## Step 1: Load the DJVU Image

To start, load the DJVU image that you want to convert. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your DJVU file:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load a DjVu image
using (DjvuImage image = (DjvuImage)Image.Load(dataDir + "Sample.djvu"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```

This code initializes the DJVU image that you want to convert and prepares it for the next steps.

## Step 2: Create Conversion Options

Next, you need to set the conversion options. In this example, we're converting DJVU to TIFF with black and white compression. Adjust the format and compression options as needed. Initialize the conversion options with the desired format:

```csharp
// Create an instance of TiffOptions with preset options and IntRange
// Initialize it with the range of pages to be exported
TiffOptions exportOptions = new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.TiffDeflateBw);
IntRange range = new IntRange(0, 2);
```

Here, we've set the conversion format to TIFF with black and white compression. Adjust these options according to your requirements.

## Step 3: Convert a Range of DJVU Pages

Now, you need to specify the range of DJVU pages you want to convert and initiate the conversion:

```csharp
// Initialize an instance of DjvuMultiPageOptions while passing an instance of IntRange
// Call Save method while passing an instance of TiffOptions
exportOptions.MultiPageOptions = new DjvuMultiPageOptions(range);
image.Save(dataDir + "ConvertRangeOfDjVuPages_out.djvu", exportOptions);
```

This code specifies the range of pages to be exported and then saves the converted file with the specified options.

## Conclusion

You've successfully learned how to convert a range of DJVU pages into another format using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. This process can be customized to fit your specific needs and preferences. Now, you can efficiently work with DJVU images and easily convert them to other formats using the power of Aspose.Imaging.
