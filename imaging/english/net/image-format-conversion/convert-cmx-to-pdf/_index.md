# Convert CMX to PDF with Aspose.Imaging for .NET

In the world of document processing and image manipulation, Aspose.Imaging for .NET stands as a powerful and versatile tool. It offers a wide array of features for image conversion and manipulation. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of converting a CMX file to PDF using Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Imaging for .NET: You must have Aspose.Imaging for .NET installed and set up. If you haven't already, you can find the documentation and download links [here](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/) and [here](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/), respectively.

2. A CMX File: You should have the CMX file that you want to convert to PDF ready in your document directory.

3. Your Document Directory: Make sure you know the path to your document directory.

Now that you have all the prerequisites in place, let's proceed with the step-by-step guide to converting a CMX file to PDF using Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Imaging:

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Cmx;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Pdf;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Text;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Load the CMX Image

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string inputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "MultiPage.cmx");

using (CmxImage image = (CmxImage)Image.Load(inputFile))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```

In this step, you specify the path to the CMX file you want to convert. You use the `Image.Load` method to load the CMX image.

## Step 2: Configure PDF Options

```csharp
PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions();
options.PdfDocumentInfo = new PdfDocumentInfo();
```

Here, you create an instance of `PdfOptions` to configure the PDF conversion settings. The `PdfDocumentInfo` allows you to set document information like title, author, and keywords.

## Step 3: Set Rasterization Options

```csharp
options.VectorRasterizationOptions = (VectorRasterizationOptions)image.GetDefaultOptions(new object[] { Color.White, image.Width, image.Height });
options.VectorRasterizationOptions.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.SingleBitPerPixel;
options.VectorRasterizationOptions.SmoothingMode = SmoothingMode.None;
```

In this step, you configure the rasterization options for the file format. You set the background color, width, and height. You can also specify text rendering hint and smoothing mode based on your requirements.

## Step 4: Save as PDF

```csharp
image.Save(dataDir + "MultiPage.pdf", options);
```

Here, you save the CMX image as a PDF with the provided options. The resulting PDF will be stored in your document directory.

## Step 5: Clean Up

```csharp
File.Delete(dataDir + "MultiPage.pdf");
```

After the conversion is complete, this step deletes the temporary PDF file, leaving your workspace clean.
