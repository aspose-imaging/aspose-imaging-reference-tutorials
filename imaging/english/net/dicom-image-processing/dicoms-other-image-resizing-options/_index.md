# DICOM's Other Image Resizing Options in Aspose.Imaging for .NET

Are you looking to work with DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) images in your .NET application? Aspose.Imaging for .NET provides a powerful set of tools to manipulate DICOM images efficiently. In this tutorial, we will delve into "DICOM's Other Image Resizing Options" using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. We will cover the prerequisites, import namespaces, and provide a step-by-step guide to help you understand and implement DICOM image resizing effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Install Aspose.Imaging for .NET
To work with DICOM images using Aspose.Imaging for .NET, you need to install the library. You can download it from the website.

[Download Aspose.Imaging for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/)

2. Set Up a Development Environment
Make sure you have a .NET development environment set up, including Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE.

3. DICOM Image
You should have a DICOM image file (e.g., "file.dcm") that you want to resize using Aspose.Imaging for .NET.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# code, you need to import the necessary namespaces to use Aspose.Imaging. Here's how to do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;
```

Now, let's break down the image resizing process into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Load the DICOM Image
To begin, you need to load the DICOM image from your file system.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (var fileStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "file.dcm", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
using (DicomImage image = new DicomImage(fileStream))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

## Step 2: Resize by Height Proportionally
You can resize the DICOM image proportionally by specifying the height in pixels and the resizing type. In this example, we use "AdaptiveResample" as the resizing type.

```csharp
image.ResizeHeightProportionally(100, ResizeType.AdaptiveResample);
```

## Step 3: Save the Resized Image
After resizing the image, you can save it in the desired format. Here, we save it as a BMP image.

```csharp
image.Save(dataDir + "DICOMSOtherImageResizingOptions_out.bmp", new BmpOptions());
```

## Step 4: Resize by Width Proportionally
You can also resize the DICOM image proportionally by specifying the width in pixels and the resizing type.

```csharp
image1.ResizeWidthProportionally(150, ResizeType.AdaptiveResample);
```

## Step 5: Save the Resized Image
Save the resized image as a BMP image, just like in the previous step.

```csharp
image1.Save(dataDir + "DICOMSOtherImageResizingOptions1_out.bmp", new BmpOptions());
```

Congratulations! You've successfully resized a DICOM image using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. This library offers various options for manipulating DICOM images, making it a valuable tool for healthcare and medical imaging applications.
