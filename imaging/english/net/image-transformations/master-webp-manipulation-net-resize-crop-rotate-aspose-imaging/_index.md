license.SetLicense("Aspose.Total.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading and Resizing a WebP Image

Efficiently resize images while maintaining high quality.

#### Step 1: Load the Image

Load your WebP image file:
```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using System.IO;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Animation1.webp");

// Use a MemoryStream to temporarily hold the resized image
using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
{
    using (WebPImage image = (WebPImage)Image.Load(inputFile))
    {
        // Resize with high-quality resampling
        image.Resize(300, 450, ResizeType.HighQualityResample);
        image.Save(ms);
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: The `Resize` method uses a specific type of resampling to maintain quality. Adjust dimensions as needed.

### Cropping a WebP Image

Precisely crop images using defined rectangular coordinates:

#### Step 2: Crop the Image
```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using System.IO;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Animation1.webp");

using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
{
    using (WebPImage image = (WebPImage)Image.Load(inputFile))
    {
        // Define the crop rectangle and apply it
        image.Crop(new Rectangle(10, 10, 200, 300));
        image.Save(ms);
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: The `Crop` method uses a `Rectangle` object to specify which part of the image should be retained.

### Rotating and Flipping a WebP Image

Rotate and flip images for better presentation:

#### Step 3: Rotate and Flip
```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using System.IO;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Animation1.webp");

using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
{
    using (WebPImage image = (WebPImage)Image.Load(inputFile))
    {
        // Rotate by 90 degrees and flip horizontally
        image.RotateFlipAll(RotateFlipType.Rotate90FlipX);
        image.Save(ms);
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: The `RotateFlip` method allows for various transformations. Choose the appropriate type based on your needs.

### Saving a Processed WebP Image to File

After manipulation, save the processed images back to disk:

#### Step 4: Save the Image
```csharp
using System.IO;

string dataDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Animation2.webp");

using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
{
    using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(outputFile, FileMode.Create))
    {
        // Write the processed image to a file
        fs.Write(ms.GetBuffer(), 0, (int)ms.Length);
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: This step ensures your manipulated images are stored permanently on disk for further use.

## Practical Applications

Here's how these features can be practically applied:
1. **Web Optimization**: Resize and crop images to improve website load times.
2. **Content Management Systems**: Automate image processing within CMS platforms.
3. **Graphic Design Tools**: Integrate into tools for dynamic image manipulation.
4. **Social Media Platforms**: Enhance user-uploaded content with automated adjustments.
5. **E-commerce Websites**: Optimize product images for better visibility and performance.

## Performance Considerations
