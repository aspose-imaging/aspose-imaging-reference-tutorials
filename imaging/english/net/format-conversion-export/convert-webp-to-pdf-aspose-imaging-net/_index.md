## Implementation Guide

### Convert WebP to PDF

This feature allows you to convert a WebP image file into a PDF document efficiently. Here's how:

#### Load the WebP Image
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Pdf;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;

string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputPath = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Load the WebP image from the specified directory.
string inputFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Animation.webp");
```

#### Create PDF Options
```csharp
using (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Webp.WebPImage image = 
    (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Webp.WebPImage)Image.Load(inputFile))
{
    // Configure the output PDF.
    PdfOptions options = new PdfOptions();
    options.PdfDocumentInfo = new PdfDocumentInfo();
}
```

#### Save as PDF
```csharp
// Define the output file path and save the image as a PDF.
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputPath, "Animation.pdf");
image.Save(outputFile, options);
```
**Explanation:** This code snippet loads a WebP image, sets up PDF conversion options, and saves it as a PDF document. Adjust `dataDir` and `outputPath` to match your directories.

### Remove Generated PDF

Post-conversion, you might want to clean up temporary files:

#### Delete the PDF
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputPath, "Animation.pdf");

// Ensure the file exists before deletion.
if (File.Exists(outputFile))
{
    File.Delete(outputFile);
}
```
**Explanation:** This code checks for the existence of the generated PDF and deletes it to free up space.

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Archiving**: Convert visual content into PDFs for long-term storage.
2. **Web Content Management**: Automate conversion processes for web resources.
3. **Presentation Preparation**: Integrate images seamlessly into presentation documents.
4. **Content Sharing**: Distribute images in a universally accessible format like PDF.
