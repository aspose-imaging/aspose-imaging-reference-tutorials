## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does Aspose.Imaging handle large batches without running out of memory?**  
A: The library uses streaming APIs and allows you to process images one‑by‑one or in configurable chunks, minimizing heap consumption. You can also enable multi‑threading to balance CPU usage.

**Q: Can I convert image java files from one format to another while preserving EXIF metadata?**  
A: Yes. When you load an image, its EXIF data is retained automatically. After conversion, you can save the image with the original metadata using the `save` method.

**Q: What is the best way to perform java image resizing for thumbnails?**  
A: Use the `resize` method with high‑quality resampling (e.g., Lanczos) and specify the target dimensions. Combine this with compression settings for optimal thumbnail size.

**Q: How do I add watermark java text to a batch of images?**  
A: Within your batch loop, create a `Graphics` object for each image, set the desired font, color, and opacity, then draw the watermark text before saving the image.

**Q: Is java image metadata editing supported for all formats?**  
A: Most common formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP) support EXIF, IPTC, and XMP metadata. For specialized formats, the library provides format‑specific metadata classes.
