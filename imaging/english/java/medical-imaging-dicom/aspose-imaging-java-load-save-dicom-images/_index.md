By the end of this guide, you'll master essential techniques with real-world applications.

**What Youâ€™ll Learn:**
- How to set up Aspose.Imaging for Java
- Loading DICOM images from a directory
- Saving processed images in different formats
- Managing files efficiently within your projects

Let's dive into the prerequisites before we get started!

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies

To follow this tutorial, you'll need:
- **Aspose.Imaging for Java** version 25.5.
- A suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.

### Environment Setup Requirements

Ensure your development environment is configured with JDK 8 or higher. This guide assumes familiarity with Maven or Gradle as a build tool.

## Setting Up Aspose.Imaging for Java

To begin, you must integrate the Aspose.Imaging library into your project. Here are the installation details for different build systems:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-imaging</artifactId>
    <version>25.5</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-imaging', version: '25.5')
```

**Direct Download**
Alternatively, download the latest version from [Aspose.Imaging for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

### License Acquisition Steps

Before you start developing:
- Obtain a **free trial license** to explore full features.
- Consider applying for a **temporary license** if needed.
- For long-term projects, purchasing a license might be necessary.

To initialize Aspose.Imaging in your application, follow these basic steps:

```java
// Example: Applying License
import com.aspose.imaging.License;

License license = new License();
license.setLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Loading and Displaying DICOM Images

#### Overview

Loading a DICOM image is the first step in processing medical imaging data. This feature will demonstrate how to use Aspose.Imaging for Java to load these files efficiently.

##### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
```

##### Step 2: Load the DICOM Image
Use the `Image.load()` method to read your DICOM file:

```java
try (Image image = Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.dcm")) {
    // The image is now loaded and ready for further manipulation.
}
```
- **Parameters:** Specify the path where your DICOM file resides.
- **Return Value:** Returns an `Image` object that represents the loaded DICOM image.

### Feature 2: Saving Images to Output Directory

#### Overview

After processing, you may need to save the image in a different format. This section explains how to save images using Aspose.Imaging.

##### Step 1: Save the Image
Use the `save()` method:

```java
try (Image image = Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.dcm")) {
    // Specify output path and file format.
    image.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SupportDicomYBR422.png");
}
```
- **Parameters:** Provide the destination path and desired file extension for saving.

### Feature 3: File Management

#### Overview

Efficiently manage files by deleting them after processing to conserve storage space.

##### Step 1: Delete Output Files
Use a utility method from Aspose:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.utils.Utils;

Utils.deleteFile("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SupportDicomYBR422.png");
```
