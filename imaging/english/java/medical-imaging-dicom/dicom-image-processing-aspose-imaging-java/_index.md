  <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspose-imaging</artifactId>
  <version>25.5</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
Add this to your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-imaging', version: '25.5')
```

- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license if you need more time.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a permanent license for long-term projects.

**Basic Initialization**
```java
import com.aspose.imaging.License;

License license = new License();
license.setLicense("path/to/your/license/file.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll explore how to apply different compression techniques using Aspose.Imaging for Java.

### Load and Save DICOM Image with No Compression

#### Overview
This feature allows you to save a DICOM image without any compression, preserving the original quality and size.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Load the Input Image**
```java
String inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/original.jpg"; // Specify your input file path.
try (Image inputImage = Image.load(inputFile)) {
    DicomOptions options = new DicomOptions();
```

**Step 2: Configure No Compression**
```java
    options.setColorType(ColorType.Rgb24Bit);
    Compression compression = new Compression();
    compression.setType(CompressionType.None);
    options.setCompression(compression);
```

**Step 3: Save the Image**
```java
    String output1 = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/original_Uncompressed.dcm";
    inputImage.save(output1, options);
}
```
By setting `CompressionType` to `None`, you ensure no data is lost during saving.

### Load and Save DICOM Image with JPEG Compression

#### Overview
JPEG compression offers a balance between file size reduction and image quality. It's ideal for scenarios where slight lossiness is acceptable.

**Step 1: Load the Input Image**
```java
String inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/original.jpg";
try (Image inputImage = Image.load(inputFile)) {
    DicomOptions options = new DicomOptions();
```

**Step 2: Configure JPEG Compression**
```java
    options.setColorType(ColorType.Rgb24Bit);
    Compression compression = new Compression();
    compression.setType(CompressionType.Jpeg);
    options.setCompression(compression);
```

**Step 3: Save the Image**
```java
    String output2 = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/original_JPEG.dcm";
    inputImage.save(output2, options);
}
```
JPEG is suitable for reducing file size while maintaining reasonable image quality.

### Load and Save DICOM Image with JPEG2000 Compression

#### Overview
JPEG2000 offers advanced compression capabilities with a focus on lossless data preservation, perfect for high-quality medical imaging.

**Step 1: Load the Input Image**
```java
String inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/original.jpg";
try (Image inputImage = Image.load(inputFile)) {
    DicomOptions options = new DicomOptions();
```

**Step 2: Configure JPEG2000 Compression**
```java
    options.setColorType(ColorType.Rgb24Bit);
    Compression compression = new Compression();
    compression.setType(CompressionType.Jpeg2000);

    Jpeg2000Options jpeg2000Options = new Jpeg2000Options();
    jpeg2000Options.setCodec(Jpeg2000Codec.Jp2);
    jpeg2000Options.setIrreversible(false); // Enable lossless mode
    compression.setJpeg2000(jpeg2000Options);
```

**Step 3: Save the Image**
```java
    String output3 = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/original_JPEG2000.dcm";
    inputImage.save(output3, options);
}
```
JPEG2000 is ideal for scenarios requiring high fidelity in compressed images.

### Load and Save DICOM Image with RLE Compression

#### Overview
Run-Length Encoding (RLE) is a lossless compression technique often used in medical imaging due to its efficiency with specific types of data.

**Step 1: Load the Input Image**
```java
String inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/original.jpg";
try (Image inputImage = Image.load(inputFile)) {
    DicomOptions options = new DicomOptions();
```

**Step 2: Configure RLE Compression**
```java
    options.setColorType(ColorType.Rgb24Bit);
    Compression compression = new Compression();
    compression.setType(CompressionType.Rle);
```

**Step 3: Save the Image**
```java
    String output4 = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/original_RLE.dcm";
    inputImage.save(output4, options);
}
```
RLE is perfect for efficiently compressing images with large areas of uniform color.

## Practical Applications

### Use Case 1: Telemedicine
Compressed DICOM files enable faster transmission over networks, crucial for remote consultations and diagnoses.
