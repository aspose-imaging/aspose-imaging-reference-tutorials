# Convert PNG Images to PDF with Aspose.Imaging for Java

In today's digital age, the ability to efficiently convert image files to PDF is a valuable skill. Aspose.Imaging for Java is a versatile library that allows you to achieve this task with ease. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore the process of converting PNG images to PDF using Aspose.Imaging for Java. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear understanding of the prerequisites, import packages, and a breakdown of each step involved in this process.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into the world of converting PNG images to PDF using Aspose.Imaging for Java, you'll need to ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install Java from the website if you haven't already.

- Aspose.Imaging for Java Library: You'll need to acquire the Aspose.Imaging for Java library. You can obtain it from the website or follow the download link provided [here](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

- A Set of PNG Images: Prepare the PNG images that you want to convert into a PDF. Place them in a directory accessible by your Java code.

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary packages from Aspose.Imaging for Java. These packages provide the functionality required for the conversion process. Here's how you can import them:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.PngImage;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.pdf.PdfDocumentInfo;
```

Now, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load PNG Images

The first step is to load the PNG images you want to convert. You can use the following code to load a PNG image:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "Png/";

try (PngImage pngImage = (PngImage) Image.load(dataDir + "aspose_logo.png"))
{
    // Your code for the conversion will follow here.
}
```

In the code above, make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your image directory and `"aspose_logo.png"` with the name of your PNG file.

## Step 2: Define PDF Export Options

In this step, you'll set up the export options for the PDF conversion. This includes specifying the PDF document information. Use the following code:

```java
PdfOptions exportOptions = new PdfOptions();
exportOptions.setPdfDocumentInfo(new PdfDocumentInfo());
```

These options will allow you to customize the PDF document information as needed.

## Step 3: Save as PDF

Now, it's time to save the loaded PNG image as a PDF. You'll use the `save` method with the export options you defined earlier. Here's how you can do it:

```java
pngImage.save(dataDir + "output.pdf", exportOptions);
```

Replace `"output.pdf"` with the desired name for your PDF file.

That's it! You've successfully converted a PNG image to a PDF using Aspose.Imaging for Java.
