# TIFF to BMP Conversion with Aspose.Imaging for Java

If you're working with image files in Java, specifically TIFF images, and need to extract frames from them and save them in BMP format, Aspose.Imaging for Java is a powerful and versatile tool to achieve this. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of extracting TIFF frames to BMP format using Aspose.Imaging for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: You should have a working Java development environment set up on your system.

2. Aspose.Imaging for Java: Ensure that you have Aspose.Imaging for Java library installed. You can download it from the website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

3. Sample TIFF Image: Have a sample TIFF image file that you want to extract frames from. Make sure to have this image available in your working directory.

## Import Packages

To start the process, you need to import the necessary packages for your Java application:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Color;
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.tiff.TiffFrame;
import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.tiff.TiffImage;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.BmpOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.sources.FileCreateSource;
```

## Step 1: Load the TIFF Image and Initialize Frame Counter

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ConvertingImages/";

try (TiffImage multiImage = (TiffImage) Image.load(dataDir + "sample.tiff"))
{
    // Create an instance of int to keep track of frames in TiffImage
    int frameCounter = 0;
```

## Step 2: Iterate Over TIFF Frames

```java
    // Iterate over the TiffFrames in TiffImage
    for (TiffFrame tiffFrame : multiImage.getFrames())
    {
        multiImage.setActiveFrame(tiffFrame);
```

## Step 3: Load Pixels of TiffFrame into an Array of Colors

```java
        // Load Pixels of TiffFrame into an array of Colors
        Color[] pixels = multiImage.loadPixels(tiffFrame.getBounds());
```

## Step 4: Create BMP Options and Set Bits Per Pixel

```java
        // Create an instance of bmpCreateOptions
        try (BmpOptions bmpCreateOptions = new BmpOptions())
        {
            bmpCreateOptions.setBitsPerPixel(24);
```

## Step 5: Save BMP Image

```java
            // Set the Source of bmpCreateOptions as FileCreateSource by specifying the location where output will be saved
            bmpCreateOptions.setSource(new FileCreateSource(String.format("%sConcatExtractTIFFFramesToBMP_out%d.bmp", "Your Document Directory", frameCounter), false));
            // Create a new bmpImage
            try (BmpImage bmpImage = (BmpImage) Image.create(bmpCreateOptions, tiffFrame.getWidth(), tiffFrame.getHeight()))
            {
                // Save the bmpImage with pixels from TiffFrame
                bmpImage.savePixels(tiffFrame.getBounds(), pixels);
                bmpImage.save();
            }
        }
        frameCounter++;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered how to extract TIFF frames and save them as BMP images using Aspose.Imaging for Java. With the right prerequisites and following the step-by-step guide, you can easily perform this image conversion task in your Java application.
