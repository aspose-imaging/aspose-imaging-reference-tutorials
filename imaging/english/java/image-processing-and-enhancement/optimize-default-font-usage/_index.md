In the world of document processing and image manipulation, Aspose.Imaging for Java stands out as a powerful tool. This versatile Java library empowers developers to create, edit, and convert images with ease. One of the key aspects of optimizing your document processing is improving font usage. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to optimize default font usage using Aspose.Imaging for Java. We'll break down each example into multiple steps to ensure you understand the process thoroughly.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the optimization process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Java development environment installed on your system.
- Aspose.Imaging for Java library. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.

## Import Packages

To get started with optimizing default font usage, you need to import the necessary packages from Aspose.Imaging for Java. Here are the steps to do that:

Import the Aspose.Imaging Library

First, include the Aspose.Imaging library in your Java project by adding the following import statement:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.fonts.FontSettings;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PngOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.odg.OdgRasterizationOptions;
```

Now that we have imported the required packages, let's break down the optimization process into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Set up Your Document Directory

Before optimizing font usage, you need to set up your document directory. Replace `"Your Document Directory" + "otg/"` with the actual path to your document directory. For example:

```java
String dataDir = "C:/Documents/";
String outDir = Utils.getOutDir("DefaultFontUsageImprove");
```

## Step 2: Configure Font Settings

To improve default font usage, configure the font settings as follows:

```java
FontSettings.setFontsFolder(Path.combine(dataDir, "fonts"));
FontSettings.setGetSystemAlternativeFont(false);
```

## Step 3: Export to PNG with Default Font

Now, let's export the document to a PNG image using the default font specified. Here, we have two examples, one using "Arial" and the other using "Courier New" as the default font.

```java
exportToPng(Path.combine(dataDir, "missing-font2.odg"), "Arial", Path.combine(outDir, "arial.png"));
exportToPng(
    Path.combine(dataDir, "missing-font2.odg"),
    "Courier New",
    Path.combine(outDir, "courier.png"));
```

## Step 4: Export to PNG Function

Here's the `exportToPng` function to perform the actual export to PNG with the specified default font:

```java
private static void exportToPng(String filePath, String defaultFontName, String outfileName)
{
    FontSettings.setDefaultFontName(defaultFontName);
    try (Image document = Image.load(filePath))
    {
        PngOptions saveOptions = new PngOptions();
        final OdgRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new OdgRasterizationOptions();
        rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1000);
        rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1000);
        saveOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
        document.save(outfileName, saveOptions);
    }
    Utils.deleteFile(outfileName);
}
```

This function sets the default font, loads the document, configures export options, and saves the output PNG image.

## Conclusion

Optimizing default font usage in document processing can greatly enhance the quality of your output. Aspose.Imaging for Java simplifies this process, allowing you to specify the font and export documents efficiently. By following the step-by-step guide outlined in this article, you can improve your font usage with ease.
