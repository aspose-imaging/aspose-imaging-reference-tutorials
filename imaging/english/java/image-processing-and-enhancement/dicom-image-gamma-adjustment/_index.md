# DICOM Image Gamma Adjustment with Aspose.Imaging for Java

Are you looking to enhance the quality of DICOM images in your Java applications? Aspose.Imaging for Java is a powerful and versatile library that allows you to manipulate and process images, including DICOM format. In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you through the process of adjusting the gamma of a DICOM image using Aspose.Imaging for Java. 

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Java Development Environment
- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### 2. Aspose.Imaging for Java Library
- You can obtain the Aspose.Imaging for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

### 3. Input DICOM Image
- You should have a DICOM image that you want to process. If you don't have one, you can easily find sample DICOM images online or use your own.

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the required packages for your Java project. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.dicom.DicomImage;
import com.aspose.imaging.image.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.BmpOptions;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
```

Let's break down the process of adjusting the gamma of a DICOM image into a series of easy-to-follow steps.

## Step 1: Set the File Paths

You need to specify the input and output file paths. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory where your DICOM image is located.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "dicom/";
String inputFile = dataDir + "image.dcm";
String outputFile = dataDir + "AdjustingGamma.bmp";
```

## Step 2: Load the DICOM Image

Load the DICOM image using Aspose.Imaging's `DicomImage` class.

```java
File file = new File(inputFile);

try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file)) {
    // Load a DICOM image in an instance of DicomImage
    try (DicomImage image = (DicomImage) Image.load(fis)) {
```

## Step 3: Adjust the Gamma

Now, adjust the gamma of the DICOM image by specifying the desired gamma value (e.g., 50).

```java
        // Adjust the gamma
        image.adjustGamma(50);
```

## Step 4: Save the Resultant Image

Create an instance of `BmpOptions` for the resultant image and save it.

```java
        // Create an instance of BmpOptions for the resultant image and save the resultant image
        image.save(outputFile, new BmpOptions());
    }
} catch (IOException ex) {
    // Handle any potential exceptions
    com.aspose.imaging.examples.Logger.println(ex.getMessage());
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

That's it! You've successfully adjusted the gamma of a DICOM image using Aspose.Imaging for Java.
