# Convert Raster Images to SVG with Aspose.Imaging for Java

Are you looking to convert raster images into scalable vector graphics (SVG) using Java? You're in the right place! This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of using Aspose.Imaging for Java to accomplish this task. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to effortlessly transform your raster images into SVG format, enabling scalability and improved image quality.

## Prerequisites

Before you embark on this image conversion journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure you have a working Java development environment, including the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

- Aspose.Imaging for Java: Download and install Aspose.Imaging for Java. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

- Sample Raster Images: Collect the raster images you want to convert to SVG and store them in a directory.

## Import Packages

To get started with the image conversion process, you need to import the necessary packages. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.SvgOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.SvgRasterizationOptions;
```

Now that you have the prerequisites and packages in place, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Initialize the Data Directory

You should define the directory where your sample images are stored. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your images:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ConvertingImages/";
```

## Step 2: Define the Image Paths

Create an array of image paths, which specifies the names of the raster images you want to convert:

```java
String[] paths = new String[]
    {
        "butterfly.gif",
        "33715-cmyk.jpeg",
        "3.JPG",
        "test.j2k",
        "Rings.png",
        "img4.TIF",
        "Lossy5.webp"
    };
```

## Step 3: Perform Conversion

Now, let's loop through the image paths and convert each raster image to SVG. The following code snippet demonstrates this process:

```java
for (String path : paths)
{
    String destPath = "Your Document Directory" + path + ".svg";
    Image image = Image.load(dataDir + path);
    try
    {
        SvgOptions svgOptions = new SvgOptions();
        SvgRasterizationOptions svgRasterizationOptions = new SvgRasterizationOptions();
        svgRasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(image.getWidth());
        svgRasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(image.getHeight());
        svgOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(svgRasterizationOptions);
        image.save(destPath, svgOptions);
    }
    finally
    {
        image.dispose();
    }
}
```

Repeat this process for each image in the `paths` array. Once completed, you will have successfully converted your raster images to SVG format using Aspose.Imaging for Java.
