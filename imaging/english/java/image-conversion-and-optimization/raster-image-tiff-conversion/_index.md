# Convert Raster Images to TIFF in Java with Aspose.Imaging

If you are looking to manipulate and convert raster images in your Java application, Aspose.Imaging for Java is the perfect tool. This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the process of converting a raster image to the TIFF format using Aspose.Imaging for Java. Before we dive into the details, let's take a look at what you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you start converting raster images to TIFF, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Java Development Environment

Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the Oracle website.

### 2. Aspose.Imaging for Java

You'll need to obtain Aspose.Imaging for Java, which provides the necessary APIs for working with various image formats. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

### 3. Basic Java Knowledge

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of Java programming. You should be familiar with concepts like classes, objects, and method calls.

## Import Packages

To begin, you need to import the required Aspose.Imaging for Java packages into your Java program. Here's how you can do that:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.TiffOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.TiffExpectedFormat;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.TiffPhotometrics;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.TiffRational;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.TiffResolutionUnits;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.TiffPlanarConfigs;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.TiffCompressions;
import com.aspose.imaging.RasterImage;
import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.tiff.TiffImage;
import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.tiff.TiffFrame;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Environment

The first step is to set up the environment. Create a directory for your project and place the raster image you want to convert to TIFF in it. You can replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your project directory.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ModifyingImages/";
```

## Step 2: Create TiffOptions

Now, create an instance of `TiffOptions` and set its various properties for the TIFF format. You can customize these options according to your requirements.

```java
TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.Default);
options.setBitsPerSample(new int[] { 8, 8, 8 });
options.setPhotometric(TiffPhotometrics.Rgb);
options.setXresolution(new TiffRational(72));
options.setYresolution(new TiffRational(72));
options.setResolutionUnit(TiffResolutionUnits.Inch);
options.setPlanarConfiguration(TiffPlanarConfigs.Contiguous);
options.setCompression(TiffCompressions.AdobeDeflate);
```

## Step 3: Load the Image

Load the existing image that you want to convert into an instance of `RasterImage`. Make sure to specify the path to your image file.

```java
try (RasterImage image = (RasterImage) Image.load(dataDir + "SampleTiff1.tiff")) {
```

## Step 4: Create TiffImage and Save

Create a new `TiffImage` from the `RasterImage` and save the resultant image while passing the instance of `TiffOptions`. You can also specify the path where you want to save the converted TIFF image.

```java
    try (TiffImage tiffImage = new TiffImage(new TiffFrame(image))) {
        tiffImage.save("Your Document Directory" + "SavingRasterImage_out.tiff", options);
    }
}
```

That's it! You've successfully converted a raster image to the TIFF format using Aspose.Imaging for Java.
