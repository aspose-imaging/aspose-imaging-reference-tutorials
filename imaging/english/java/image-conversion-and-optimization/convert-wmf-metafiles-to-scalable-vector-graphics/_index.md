# Convert WMF Metafiles to Scalable Vector Graphics

## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on how to convert WMF (Windows Metafile) images to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) using Aspose.Imaging for Java. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this tutorial will provide you with all the essential information you need to perform this task efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java properly installed on your system.

2. Aspose.Imaging Library: You'll need the Aspose.Imaging for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

3. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment): We recommend using popular Java IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans for this tutorial.

Now, let's get started with the step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Import Packages

In your Java code, you must import the necessary Aspose.Imaging packages to work with WMF and SVG files. Add the following imports at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.SvgOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.WmfRasterizationOptions;
```

## Step 2: Load the WMF Image

Next, you need to load the WMF image you want to convert to SVG. Here's how you can do it:

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ModifyingImages/";

// Create an instance of Image class by loading an existing WMF file.
try (Image image = Image.load(dataDir + "input.wmf")) {
    // Your code goes here...
}
```

## Step 3: Set Rasterization Options

To customize the SVG output, create an instance of the `WmfRasterizationOptions` class. This step allows you to specify the page width and height for the SVG image.

```java
final WmfRasterizationOptions options = new WmfRasterizationOptions();
options.setPageWidth(image.getWidth()); // Set the page width
options.setPageHeight(image.getHeight()); // Set the page height
```

## Step 4: Save as SVG

Now, it's time to save the WMF image as an SVG file. This step involves calling the `save` method and passing the output file name and the `SvgOptions` class instance.

```java
image.save("Your Document Directory" + "ConvertWMFMetaFileToSVG_out.svg", new SvgOptions() {{ setVectorRasterizationOptions(options); }});
```

That's it! You've successfully converted a WMF image to an SVG file using Aspose.Imaging for Java.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've walked you through the process of converting WMF Metafiles to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in Java using Aspose.Imaging. With the right tools and these easy-to-follow steps, you can handle image format conversions effortlessly. 

Now you're ready to unleash your creativity with scalable and versatile SVG images. For more information and detailed API documentation, visit the [Aspose.Imaging for Java documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/).
