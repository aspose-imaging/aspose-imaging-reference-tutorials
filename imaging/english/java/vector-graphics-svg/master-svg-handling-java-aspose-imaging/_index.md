# Mastering SVG Handling in Java with Aspose.Imaging: Load, Save, and Export

## Introduction

Handling vector graphics efficiently is crucial for developers working on applications that require high-quality image rendering. Whether you're designing a web application or building complex graphic interfaces, managing SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) can be challenging due to the need to balance performance with quality. This tutorial introduces Aspose.Imaging Java as a powerful tool to streamline these tasks by loading and saving SVG images, both with and without embedded resources. 

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to load and save SVG images using Aspose.Imaging for Java.
- Techniques for embedding resources within SVGs.
- Methods for exporting images from SVG files effectively.
- Handling image resources during export.

By the end of this guide, you will have a comprehensive understanding of leveraging Aspose.Imaging Java to manage SVGs seamlessly. Let's dive into the prerequisites and setup before we begin implementing these features.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your development environment is prepared:

### Required Libraries
- **Aspose.Imaging for Java**: Version 25.5 or later.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
- Maven or Gradle build tool configured in your project.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming and object-oriented concepts.
- Familiarity with handling file I/O operations in Java.

## Setting Up Aspose.Imaging for Java

To begin using Aspose.Imaging Java, you need to include it as a dependency in your project. Here's how:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-imaging</artifactId>
    <version>25.5</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-imaging:25.5'
```

Alternatively, download the latest version directly from [Aspose.Imaging for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

### License Acquisition

To get started with a free trial, you can obtain a temporary license by visiting [Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/). This will allow you to explore all features without any limitations. For continued use, consider purchasing a full license from [Purchase Aspose.Imaging](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization

Once your project is set up with the necessary dependencies, initialize Aspose.Imaging in your Java application as follows:

```java
// Initialize License for Aspose.Imaging (if you have one)
License license = new License();
license.setLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");
```

With the setup complete, let's move on to implementing SVG handling features.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Loading and Saving SVG Images with Embedded Resources

This feature allows you to load an existing image and save it as an SVG file while embedding any required resources directly within the SVG. This is particularly useful for ensuring that all visual elements are self-contained, facilitating easy sharing or display in environments where external resource access might be restricted.

#### Overview
- Load an SVG image.
- Configure settings using `EmfRasterizationOptions`.
- Save the image as SVG with embedded resources.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Load the Image**

```java
Image image = Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/auto.svg");
```

Here, you load the original image from a specified directory. Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/auto.svg"` with your actual file path.

**Step 2: Configure Rasterization Options**

```java
EmfRasterizationOptions emfRasterizationOptions = new EmfRasterizationOptions();
emfRasterizationOptions.setBackgroundColor(Color.getWhite());
emfRasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(image.getWidth());
emfRasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(image.getHeight());
```

These options determine how the image will be rasterized. We set the background color and adjust the page dimensions to match the original image.

**Step 3: Set Up SVG Options**

```java
SvgOptions svgOptions = new SvgOptions();
svgOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(emfRasterizationOptions);
```

This step configures the `SvgOptions` object, which will be used when saving the file. It links our rasterization options to ensure they are applied during the save operation.

**Step 4: Save the Image with Embedded Resources**

```java
image.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/auto_Embedded.svg", svgOptions);
```

Finally, we save the loaded image as an SVG with all resources embedded. Replace `"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/auto_Embedded.svg"` with your desired output path.

### Feature 2: Exporting Images from SVG without Embedding

When you need to separate images from their parent SVG file for flexibility or performance reasons, exporting instead of embedding is a viable solution.

#### Overview
- Prepare a directory for exported resources.
- Load the SVG image.
- Configure `SvgOptions` with custom callbacks for resource handling.
- Export resources separately and save the modified SVG.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Set Up Output Directory**

```java
File dir = new File("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/exported_images/");
if (!dir.exists()) {
    dir.mkdirs();
}
```

Ensure that a directory exists to store exported images, creating it if necessary.

**Step 2: Load the Image and Configure Options**

Similar to Feature 1, load your SVG image and configure `EmfRasterizationOptions`.

```java
Image image = Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/auto.svg");
EmfRasterizationOptions emfRasterizationOptions = new EmfRasterizationOptions();
emfRasterizationOptions.setBackgroundColor(Color.getWhite());
emfRasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(image.getWidth());
emfRasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(image.getHeight());
```

**Step 3: Implement Custom Resource Handling**

```java
SvgCallbackImageTest callback = new SvgCallbackImageTest(false, "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/exported_images/");
callback.setLink("exported_images/auto.svg");

SvgOptions svgOptions = new SvgOptions();
svgOptions.setVectorRasterizationOptions(emfRasterizationOptions);
svgOptions.setCallback(callback);
```

This setup uses `SvgCallbackImageTest` to handle image resources separately. The callback determines whether to embed or export images based on the provided logic.

**Step 4: Save with Exported Resources**

```java
image.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/exported_images/auto_Stream.svg", svgOptions);
```

Save your SVG, exporting resources as needed. Adjust the output path accordingly.

### Feature 3: Handling Image Resources During Export

Managing image resources during export ensures that images are correctly handled according to your application's needs, whether embedding them or saving separately.

#### Overview
- Clean up existing files in the output directory.
- Handle image resource export by writing data to specific files.
- Return relative paths for saved images to maintain references within SVGs.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Setup Resource Callback**

```java
class SvgCallbackImageTest extends SvgResourceKeeperCallback {
    private final boolean useEmbeddedImage;
    private final String outFolder;

    public SvgCallbackImageTest(boolean useEmbeddedImage, String outFolder) {
        this.useEmbeddedImage = useEmbeddedImage;
        File dir = new File(outFolder);
        if (dir.exists()) {
            for (File file : dir.listFiles()) {
                file.delete();
            }
            dir.delete();
        }
        this.outFolder = outFolder;
    }

    public void setLink(String link) { /* Set the relative path */ }
}
```

This callback class prepares the environment by cleaning up any existing files before handling new exports.

**Step 2: Export Resources**

```java
@Override
public String onImageResourceReady(byte[] imageData, int imageType, String suggestedFileName, boolean[] useEmbeddedImageFlag) {
    useEmbeddedImageFlag[0] = this.useEmbeddedImage;
    
    if (!this.useEmbeddedImage) {
        File file = new File(this.outFolder + suggestedFileName);
        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file)) {
            fos.write(imageData);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error writing image resource", e);
        }
        return "./" + this.link + "/" + suggestedFileName;
    }

    return suggestedFileName;
}
```

This method decides whether to embed or export the image, saving it if necessary and returning its path.
