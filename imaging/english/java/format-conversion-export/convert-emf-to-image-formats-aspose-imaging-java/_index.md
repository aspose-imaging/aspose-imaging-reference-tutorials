public class SetupAspose {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        License license = new License();
        try {
            // Apply license from a file path or stream
            license.setLicense("path/to/your/license/file.lic");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Failed to apply Aspose.Imaging license.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

This section will guide you through the process of converting EMF files into various formats using Aspose.Imaging for Java.

### Convert EMF to BMP

#### Overview
Converting an EMF file to a Bitmap (BMP) format is straightforward. The `BmpOptions` class handles the conversion settings.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Load the EMF Image**

   ```java
   import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
   import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.EmfImage;

   EmfImage metafile = (EmfImage) Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Picture1.emf");
   ```

2. **Save as BMP Using BmpOptions**

   ```java
   import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.BmpOptions;

   try {
       metafile.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertEMFtoBMP_out.bmp", new BmpOptions());
   } finally {
       metafile.dispose();
   }
   ```

### Convert EMF to JPG

#### Overview
The `JpegOptions` class provides various settings, such as quality adjustments for JPEG images.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Load the EMF Image**

   ```java
   EmfImage metafile = (EmfImage) Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Picture1.emf");
   ```

2. **Save as JPG Using JpegOptions**

   ```java
   import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.JpegOptions;

   try {
       metafile.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertEMFtoJPG_out.jpg", new JpegOptions());
   } finally {
       metafile.dispose();
   }
   ```

### Convert EMF to PNG

#### Overview
PNG format supports transparency and lossless compression, making it ideal for various applications.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Load the EMF Image**

   ```java
   EmfImage metafile = (EmfImage) Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Picture1.emf");
   ```

2. **Save as PNG Using PngOptions**

   ```java
   import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PngOptions;

   try {
       metafile.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertEMFToPNG_out.png", new PngOptions());
   } finally {
       metafile.dispose();
   }
   ```

### Convert EMF to GIF

#### Overview
GIF format is great for simple animations and supports a limited color palette.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Load the EMF Image**

   ```java
   EmfImage metafile = (EmfImage) Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Picture1.emf");
   ```

2. **Save as GIF Using GifOptions**

   ```java
   import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.GifOptions;

   try {
       metafile.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertEMFToGIF_out.gif", new GifOptions());
   } finally {
       metafile.dispose();
   }
   ```

### Convert EMF to TIFF

#### Overview
TIFF is a flexible format that supports multiple layers and high-quality images.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Load the EMF Image**

   ```java
   EmfImage metafile = (EmfImage) Image.load("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Picture1.emf");
   ```

2. **Save as TIFF Using TiffOptions**

   ```java
   import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.TiffOptions;
   import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.tiff.enums.TiffExpectedFormat;

   try {
       metafile.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertEMFToTIFF_out.tiff", new TiffOptions(TiffExpectedFormat.Default));
   } finally {
       metafile.dispose();
   }
   ```

## Practical Applications

Converting EMF files to different image formats using Aspose.Imaging for Java has numerous applications:

1. **Web Optimization**: Convert images to web-friendly formats like JPG and PNG for faster loading times.
