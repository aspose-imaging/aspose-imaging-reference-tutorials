  <artifactId>aspose-imaging</artifactId>
  <version>25.5</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle Installation

For Gradle users, include this line in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-imaging', version: '25.5')
```

### Direct Download

Alternatively, download the latest version from [Aspose.Imaging for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup

To initialize, import the necessary classes:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.GifOptions;
```

## Implementation Guide

Now let's walk through the steps to convert a WebP image to GIF using Aspose.Imaging for Java.

### Loading a WebP Image

**Overview:** This section demonstrates how to load an existing WebP image file into your Java application.

1. **Define Paths:**
   Specify the path to your document directory and input file:

   ```java
   String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
   String inputFile = dataDir + "/Animation.webp";
   ```

2. **Load the Image:**
   Use `Image.load()` to load the WebP image:

   ```java
   Image image = Image.load(inputFile);
   ```

### Configuring GIF Options

**Overview:** Configure options for saving your image in GIF format.

1. **Create GifOptions:**

   Initialize a new instance of `GifOptions`:

   ```java
   GifOptions options = new GifOptions();
   ```

2. **Customize as Needed:**
   Explore and set additional properties on the `options` object to tailor the GIF output.

### Saving a WebP Image as GIF

**Overview:** Save your loaded WebP image as a GIF using the configured options.

1. **Define Output Path:**

   Set up the directory and file path for the output:

   ```java
   String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   Path outputFile = Paths.get(outDir + "/Animation.gif");
   ```

2. **Save the Image:**
   
   Use `image.save()` to save your image in GIF format:

   ```java
   image.save(outputFile.toString(), options);
   ```

3. **Clean Up:**

   Optionally delete the output file if needed:

   ```java
   import java.nio.file.Files;
   Files.deleteIfExists(outputFile);
   ```

## Practical Applications

Converting WebP to GIF has several real-world applications, including:
- **Web Development:** Enhance website performance by using optimized image formats.
- **Marketing Material:** Create engaging animated graphics for campaigns.
- **Content Management Systems (CMS):** Integrate into systems requiring dynamic content display.
