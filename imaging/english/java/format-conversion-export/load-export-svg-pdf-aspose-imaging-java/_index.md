# How to Efficiently Load and Export SVG to PDF Using Aspose.Imaging Java

In today's digital world, converting vector graphics like Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) into Portable Document Format (PDF) is a common requirement across various industries such as publishing, design, and web development. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using Aspose.Imaging for Java to load SVG files and export them as PDFs while also handling fonts effectively.

## What You'll Learn

- Load and convert SVG files to PDF with ease
- Handle font embedding or streaming during conversion
- Optimize your code for performance and efficiency
- Implement practical applications in real-world scenarios

Ready to dive into the world of Aspose.Imaging Java? Let's get started!

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Required Libraries**: You'll need Aspose.Imaging for Java version 25.5.
- **Environment Setup**: A working Java Development Kit (JDK) and an integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of Java programming, especially file I/O operations.

### Setting Up Aspose.Imaging for Java

To use Aspose.Imaging in your project, you need to include it as a dependency. Here are the different ways you can set it up:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-imaging</artifactId>
    <version>25.5</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-imaging', version: '25.5')
```

**Direct Download**: You can download the latest version from [Aspose.Imaging for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

To start using Aspose.Imaging, you need to acquire a license. You can get a free trial or request a temporary license if you're evaluating its features. For full access, consider purchasing a subscription.

### Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into two main functionalities: exporting SVG to PDF and saving SVG with specific font handling options.

#### Load and Export SVG to PDF

**Overview**: This feature enables you to convert an SVG file into a high-quality PDF document using Aspose.Imaging for Java.

1. **Prepare Your Environment**

   Ensure that your project has the necessary setup, including the Aspose.Imaging dependency configured as shown earlier.

2. **Load the SVG File**

   Use the `Image.load()` method to load your SVG file from a specified directory. This step initializes the image object which will be used for conversion.
   
   ```java
   final Image image = Image.load(inputFile);
   ```

3. **Configure PDF Export Options**

   Set up `PdfOptions` with `SvgRasterizationOptions` to match the page size of your SVG dimensions.

   ```java
   new PdfOptions()
   {
{
       setVectorRasterizationOptions(new SvgRasterizationOptions() 
       {
{
           setSize(image.getWidth(), image.getHeight());
       }
});
   }
};
   ```

4. **Save as PDF**

   Use the `image.save()` method to export the loaded SVG file into a PDF document.

   ```java
   image.save(outFile, pdfOptions);
   ```

5. **Resource Management**

   Always dispose of your Image object after use to free up resources.

   ```java
   finally
   {
       image.dispose();
   }
   ```

#### Save SVG with Font Handling Options

**Overview**: This feature allows you to save an SVG file with options for font embedding or streaming, providing flexibility in how fonts are managed within the document.

1. **Initialize Image and Rasterization Options**

   Load your input SVG using `Image.load()` and set up `EmfRasterizationOptions` to define background color and page size.
   
   ```java
   final EmfRasterizationOptions emfRasterizationOptions = new EmfRasterizationOptions();
   emfRasterizationOptions.setBackgroundColor(Color.getWhite());
   ```

2. **Configure Font Handling**

   Use a callback mechanism with `SvgResourceKeeperCallback` to decide whether fonts should be embedded or streamed.

   ```java
   setCallback(new SvgResourceKeeperCallback()
   {
{
       public void onFontResourceReady(FontStoringArgs args)
       {
           if (useEmbedded) 
               args.setFontStoreType(FontStoreType.Embedded);
           else 
           {
               // Handle streaming font logic here...
           }
       }
   }
});
   ```

3. **Save the SVG File**

   Save your SVG file with these configurations.

   ```java
   image.save(outputFile, new SvgOptions()
   {
{
       setVectorRasterizationOptions(emfRasterizationOptions);
   }
});
   ```

### Practical Applications

1. **Publishing Industry**: Convert design drafts into print-ready PDFs while preserving vector quality.
2. **Web Development**: Export web graphics for offline viewing with embedded fonts ensuring consistent display.
3. **Graphic Design**: Batch convert multiple SVG files to PDFs for archiving or sharing across different platforms.

### Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of images and streams promptly after use.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Ensure proper cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large volumes by processing files in batches, especially when dealing with numerous SVGs.
