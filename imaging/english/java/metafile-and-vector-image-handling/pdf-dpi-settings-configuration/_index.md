# Convert Images to PDF with Aspose.Imaging for Java

In today's digital age, the ability to manipulate and convert images is a valuable skill. Whether you're working on a graphic design project, archiving documents, or simply need to convert images to a more accessible format, Aspose.Imaging for Java is a powerful solution. In this step-by-step guide, we'll explore how to convert images to PDF using Aspose.Imaging for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the website.

2. Aspose.Imaging for Java: You'll need to download and install Aspose.Imaging for Java. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

3. Your Document Directory: Create a directory where you'll store your image files. Make sure you know the path to this directory.

## Import Packages

Before you start writing code, you'll need to import the necessary packages. This ensures that you can use the Aspose.Imaging library in your Java application. Add the following import statements to your Java class:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.SizeF;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the Image

The first step in converting an image to PDF is to load the image. Use the following code to load the image from your document directory:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ModifyingImages/";
String fileName = "SampleTiff1.tiff";
String inputFileName = dataDir + fileName;

try (Image image = Image.load(inputFileName)) {
    // Your code for further steps will go here
}
```

In this code, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory and `"SampleTiff1.tiff"` with the name of your image file.

## Step 2: Configure PDF Settings

Next, you need to configure the PDF settings. This includes specifying the page size and any other options you want to apply to the PDF. Here's an example of how to set the page size:

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setPageSize(new SizeF(612, 792));
```

You can customize these options according to your specific requirements.

## Step 3: Save as PDF

Finally, you'll save the image as a PDF. Use the following code to do that:

```java
String outFileName = "Your Document Directory" + fileName + ".pdf";
image.save(outFileName, pdfOptions);
```

Ensure you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory, and `"SampleTiff1.tiff"` with your image file name.

And that's it! You've successfully converted an image to PDF using Aspose.Imaging for Java. You can use this powerful library for various image manipulation tasks and automation.

## Conclusion

Aspose.Imaging for Java provides a robust solution for image conversion and manipulation.
