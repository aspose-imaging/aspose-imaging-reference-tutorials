# Creating WMF Images with Aspose.Imaging for Java

Are you looking to create WMF (Windows Metafile) images with your Java applications? Aspose.Imaging for Java is a powerful tool that allows you to generate WMF images with ease. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of using Aspose.Imaging for Java to create WMF metafile images. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Java development environment set up on your computer.
- Aspose.Imaging for Java library installed. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.

## Import Packages

First, import the necessary packages for your Java application to use Aspose.Imaging for Java:

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.*;
import com.aspose.imaging.brushes.*;
import com.aspose.imaging.color.*;
import com.aspose.imaging.coreexceptions.ImageLoadException;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.WmfOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.internal.system.drawing.*;
import com.aspose.imaging.internal.system.drawing.imaging.*;
import com.aspose.imaging.pen.*;
import com.aspose.imaging.system.drawing.*;
```

## Step 1: Create a Canvas

To start creating your WMF image, you need to create a canvas where you can draw shapes. The `WmfRecorderGraphics2D` class provides you with this canvas. Here's how you can create an instance of it:

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ModifyingImages/";
WmfRecorderGraphics2D graphics = new WmfRecorderGraphics2D(new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 100), 96);
```

In the code above, we specify the canvas dimensions (100x100) and the resolution (96 DPI).

## Step 2: Set Background Color

Next, define the background color for your canvas. You can use the `setBackgroundColor` method to set the background color:

```java
graphics.setBackgroundColor(Color.getWhiteSmoke());
```

In this example, we set the background color to white smoke.

## Step 3: Define Pen and Brush

To draw shapes on the canvas, you need to define a pen and a brush. The pen is used for drawing outlines, and the brush is used for filling shapes. Here's how you can create a pen and a solid brush:

```java
Pen pen = new Pen(Color.getBlue());
Brush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.getYellowGreen());
```

In this code, we create a blue pen and a yellow-green solid brush.

## Step 4: Fill and Draw Shapes

Now, let's fill and draw some basic shapes on the canvas. We'll start with a polygon:

```java
graphics.fillPolygon(brush, new Point[] { new Point(2, 2), new Point(20, 20), new Point(20, 2) });
graphics.drawPolygon(pen, new Point[] { new Point(2, 2), new Point(20, 20), new Point(20, 2) });
```

Here, we fill and draw a polygon using the specified pen and brush. You can adjust the coordinates and shapes as needed.

## Step 5: Use HatchBrush

To add textures to your shapes, you can use a `HatchBrush`. For example:

```java
HatchBrush hatchBrush = new HatchBrush();
hatchBrush.setHatchStyle(HatchStyle.Cross);
hatchBrush.setBackgroundColor(Color.getWhite());
hatchBrush.setForegroundColor(Color.getSilver());
brush = hatchBrush;
```

In this code, we create a cross-hatch brush with white and silver colors.

## Step 6: Fill and Draw Ellipse

Let's fill and draw an ellipse on the canvas:

```java
graphics.fillEllipse(brush, new Rectangle(25, 2, 20, 20));
graphics.drawEllipse(pen, new Rectangle(25, 2, 20, 20));
```

You can adjust the position and size of the ellipse as needed.

## Step 7: Draw Arc and Cubic Bezier

Drawing more complex shapes is also possible. Here's how to draw an arc and a cubic Bezier curve:

```java
pen.setDashStyle(DashStyle.Dot);
pen.setColor(Color.getBlack());
graphics.drawArc(pen, new Rectangle(50, 2, 20, 20), 0, 180);

pen.setDashStyle(DashStyle.Solid);
pen.setColor(Color.getRed());
graphics.drawCubicBezier(pen, new Point(10, 25), new Point(20, 50), new Point(30, 50), new Point(40, 25));
```

In the code above, we first draw an arc with a dotted line style, and then we draw a cubic Bezier curve with a solid red pen.

## Step 8: Add Images

You can also add images to your WMF metafile. Here's how to do it:

```java
try (RasterImage rasterImage = (RasterImage)Image.load(dataDir + "WaterMark.bmp"))
{
    graphics.drawImage(rasterImage, new Point(50, 50));
}
```

In this step, we load an image and place it on the canvas at the specified coordinates (50, 50).

## Step 9: Draw Lines and Pie

To add lines and pie shapes, you can follow these examples:

```java
graphics.drawLine(pen, new Point(2, 98), new Point(2, 50));

brush = new SolidBrush(Color.getGreen());
pen.setColor(Color.getDarkGoldenrod());

graphics.fillPie(brush, new Rectangle(2, 38, 20, 20), 0, 45);
graphics.drawPie(pen, new Rectangle(2, 38, 20, 20), 0, 45);
```

Here, we draw a line and fill/draw a pie shape using the specified pen and brush.

## Step 10: Draw Polyline and Text

Adding text and polylines is straightforward:

```java
graphics.drawPolyline(pen, new Point[] { new Point(50, 40), new Point(75, 40), new Point(75, 45), new Point(50, 45) });

Font font = new Font("Arial", 16);
graphics.drawString("Aspose", font, Color.getBlue(), 25, 75);
```

You can customize the font, text, and polyline points as needed.

## Step 11: Save the WMF Image

Once you've created your WMF image, it's time to save it:

```java
try (WmfImage image = graphics.endRecording())
{
    image.save("Your Document Directory" + "CreateWMFMetaFileImage.wmf");
}
```

This code will save the WMF image to the specified directory.

That's it! You've successfully generated a WMF metafile image using Aspose.Imaging for Java.
