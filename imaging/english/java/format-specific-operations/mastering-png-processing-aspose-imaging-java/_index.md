```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-imaging</artifactId>
    <version>25.5</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
Include this line in your `build.gradle`:
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-imaging:25.5'
```

### Direct Download
Alternatively, you can download the latest version directly from [Aspose.Imaging for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

#### Licensing
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full access during evaluation.
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a license.

## Implementation Guide

### Load and Save PNG Images

This feature allows you to load an image from disk, process it, and save the result back. Here's how:

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Classes
```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.png.PngImage;
```

#### Step 2: Load the PNG Image
Specify your document directory and load the image:
```java
String baseFolder = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Png";
String imageFilePath = baseFolder + "/ball.png";

try (Image image = Image.load(imageFilePath)) {
    PngImage pngImage = (PngImage) image;
```

#### Step 3: Save the Processed Image
After processing, save the image to a new location:
```java
    String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/result.png";
    pngImage.save(outputFilePath);
}
```

### Create Graphics Path and Add Shape

Creating shapes can be essential for graphic design within images:

#### Step 1: Import Required Classes
```java
import com.aspose.imaging.GraphicsPath;
import com.aspose.imaging.RectangleF;
import com.aspose.imaging.shapes.EllipseShape;
import com.aspose.imaging.shapes.Figure;
```

#### Step 2: Create a Graphics Path and Add an Ellipse Shape
Define the shape and add it to your graphics path:
```java
GraphicsPath mask = new GraphicsPath();
Figure firstFigure = new Figure();
firstFigure.addShape(new EllipseShape(new RectangleF(350, 170, 220, 230)));
mask.addFigure(firstFigure);
```

### Configure Content-Aware Fill Watermark Options

This feature allows you to configure watermark options for seamless integration:

#### Step 1: Create an Instance of `ContentAwareFillWatermarkOptions`
```java
import com.aspose.imaging.watermark.options.ContentAwareFillWatermarkOptions;

GraphicsPath mask = new GraphicsPath();
ContentAwareFillWatermarkOptions options = new ContentAwareFillWatermarkOptions(mask);
options.setMaxPaintingAttempts(4);
```

### Remove Watermark Using Paint Over Method

Removing watermarks can be crucial for restoring images:

#### Step 1: Setup and Load Image
```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.png.PngImage;
import com.aspose.imaging.watermark.WatermarkRemover;

String imageFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Png/ball.png";

try (Image image = Image.load(imageFilePath)) {
    PngImage pngImage = (PngImage) image;
```

#### Step 2: Configure and Apply Watermark Removal
Create a mask, configure options, and apply the removal:
```java
    GraphicsPath mask = new GraphicsPath();
    Figure firstFigure = new Figure();
    firstFigure.addShape(new EllipseShape(new RectangleF(350, 170, 220, 230)));
    mask.addFigure(firstFigure);
    
    ContentAwareFillWatermarkOptions options = new ContentAwareFillWatermarkOptions(mask);
    options.setMaxPaintingAttempts(4);

    RasterImage result = WatermarkRemover.paintOver(pngImage, options);
    String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/result.png";
    result.save(outputFilePath);
}
```

## Practical Applications

These features can be used in various real-world scenarios:
- **Photo Editing Software**: Enhance images with custom shapes and remove unwanted watermarks.
- **Digital Asset Management**: Automate watermarking for content protection.
- **Graphic Design Tools**: Integrate dynamic shape creation into design workflows.

## Performance Considerations

When working with image processing, consider the following tips:
- Optimize memory usage by managing large files efficiently.
- Use multi-threading where applicable to improve performance.
- Regularly update Aspose.Imaging to benefit from optimizations and new features.
