In the world of document conversion, Aspose.Imaging for Java stands out as a powerful tool that allows you to easily convert ODG (OpenDocument Graphics) files into PNG and PDF formats. This tutorial will guide you through the process, step by step, using Aspose.Imaging for Java. Whether you're a developer or just someone looking to convert ODG files, this article will help you achieve your goal.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, you'll need to make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Java Development Environment

Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your system. You can download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### 2. Aspose.Imaging for Java

You'll need to download and install Aspose.Imaging for Java. You can find the latest version on the [Aspose.Imaging for Java download page](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/).

### 3. ODG Files

Of course, you'll need the ODG files that you want to convert. Make sure you have these files available in a directory on your system.

## Import Packages

Now that you've got the prerequisites in place, let's start with importing the necessary packages in your Java project. These packages will allow you to work with Aspose.Imaging for Java effectively.

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.SizeF;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PdfOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PngOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.OdgRasterizationOptions;
```

We'll now break down the conversion process into simple steps to make it easy to follow. For each step, we'll provide a heading and an explanation.

## Step 1: Define Your Data Directory

Begin by specifying the directory where your ODG files are located. You'll need to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your directory.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ConvertingImages/";
```

## Step 2: Specify ODG Files

Create an array of ODG file names that you want to convert. Replace the example file names with the names of your ODG files.

```java
String[] files = new String[] {"example.odg", "example1.odg"};
```

## Step 3: Configure Rasterization Options

Set up the rasterization options for ODG files. These options will determine the page size and vector rasterization settings.

```java
final OdgRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new OdgRasterizationOptions();
```

## Step 4: Loop Through ODG Files

Now, iterate through each ODG file, load it, and convert it to both PNG and PDF formats.

```java
for (String file : files) {
    String fileName = dataDir + file;
    try (Image image = Image.load(fileName)) {
        rasterizationOptions.setPageSize(new SizeF(image.getWidth(), image.getHeight()));

        // Convert to PNG
        String outFileName = "Your Document Directory" + file.replace(".odg", ".png");
        image.save(outFileName, new PngOptions() {{
            setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
        }});

        // Convert to PDF
        outFileName = "Your Document Directory" + file.replace(".odg", ".pdf");
        image.save(outFileName, new PdfOptions() {{
            setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);
        }});
    }
}
```

Congratulations! You've successfully converted your ODG files to both PNG and PDF formats using Aspose.Imaging for Java.
