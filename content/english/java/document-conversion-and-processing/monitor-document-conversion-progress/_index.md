In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Aspose.Imaging for Java to perform image conversion and manipulation. Aspose.Imaging for Java is a powerful Java library that enables you to work with various image formats, making it an essential tool for developers who deal with image processing in their applications. We will break down the process into easy-to-follow steps to help you get started.

## Introduction

Aspose.Imaging for Java is a versatile and feature-rich library for working with images in your Java applications. Whether you need to convert, manipulate, or enhance images, Aspose.Imaging provides a wide range of functions and options. In this tutorial, we will focus on image conversion and guide you through the process of converting an image to a different format.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with Aspose.Imaging for Java, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment

You need a Java development environment installed on your system. If you haven't already, download and install the latest version of Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads).

2. Aspose.Imaging for Java

Download and install the Aspose.Imaging for Java library. You can find the download link on the [Aspose.Imaging for Java page](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/java/). Make sure to include the library in your Java project.

3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

You can use any Java IDE of your choice. Popular options include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans. Ensure that your IDE is set up and ready for Java development.

## Import Packages

Once you have the prerequisites in place, it's time to start using Aspose.Imaging for Java in your project. Begin by importing the necessary packages and setting up your project.

```java
import com.aspose.imaging.Image;
import com.aspose.imaging.LoadOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions.JpegOptions;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageloadoptions.ProgressEventHandler;
import com.aspose.imaging.imageloadoptions.ProgressEventHandlerInfo;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
```

In the code above, we import the required Aspose.Imaging packages and set up the necessary classes for image conversion and progress handling.

## Step 1: Set Up the Directory and Input Image

To get started with image conversion, you need to specify the directory containing your input image. You should also define the input file name.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory" + "ConvertingImages/";
String fileName = "aspose-logo.jpg";
String inputFileName = dataDir + fileName;
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your document directory and `"aspose-logo.jpg"` with the name of your input image file.

## Step 2: Load the Input Image

Now, let's load the input image using Aspose.Imaging. We also set up a progress event handler to monitor the loading progress.

```java
try (Image image = Image.load(inputFileName, new LoadOptions() {
    {
        setIProgressEventHandler(new ProgressEventHandler() {
            @Override
            public void invoke(ProgressEventHandlerInfo info) {
                progressCallback(info);
            }
        });
    }
})) {
    // Image loaded successfully
    // You can perform further operations on the loaded image here
}
```

In this step, we load the input image and set up a progress event handler to track the loading progress. The `progressCallback` method will be called to report the progress.

## Step 3: Save the Output Image

Now that the input image is loaded, you can specify the output file format and save the image. In this example, we are saving the image as a JPEG with baseline compression and 100% quality. Similar to the loading step, we set up a progress event handler for the export process.

```java
image.save(
    Path.combine("Your Document Directory", "outputFile_Baseline.jpg"),
    new JpegOptions() {
        {
            setCompressionType(JpegCompressionMode.Baseline);
            setQuality(100);
            setProgressEventHandler(new ProgressEventHandler() {
                @Override
                public void invoke(ProgressEventHandlerInfo info) {
                    exportProgressCallback(info);
                }
            });
        }
    });
```

Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the desired output directory and specify the output file name and format.

## Step 4: Progress Callbacks

Both during the loading and saving of the image, progress event handlers are used to report progress. Here's how you can implement these progress callback methods:

```java
static void progressCallback(ProgressEventHandlerInfo info) {
    Logger.printf("Progress %s : %d/%d", info.getEventType(), info.getValue(), info.getMaxValue());
}

static void exportProgressCallback(ProgressEventHandlerInfo info) {
    Logger.printf("Export event %s : %d/%d", info.getEventType(), info.getValue(), info.getMaxValue());
}
```

These methods will log progress information, allowing you to monitor the conversion process.

Now you have successfully converted an image using Aspose.Imaging for Java. This tutorial provided a step-by-step guide for using the library to load and save images, along with progress monitoring.
