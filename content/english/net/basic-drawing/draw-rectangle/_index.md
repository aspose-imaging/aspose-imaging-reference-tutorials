Creating and manipulating images in .NET applications can be a complex task, but with the power of Aspose.Imaging for .NET, it becomes remarkably simple. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of drawing rectangles using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. You'll learn how to create an image, set its properties, draw rectangles, and save your work. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Imaging for .NET: Make sure you have installed the Aspose.Imaging for .NET library. If you haven't already, you can download it from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/imaging/net/).

2. Development Environment: You should have a development environment set up with Visual Studio or any other .NET development tool.

Now, let's begin with the step-by-step tutorial.

## Importing Namespaces

The first step is to import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Imaging for .NET. Here's how you do it:

### Step 1: Import Namespaces

```csharp
using Aspose.Imaging;
using Aspose.Imaging.Brushes;
using Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions;
using Aspose.Imaging.Sources;
```

In the above code, we're importing the Aspose.Imaging namespaces, which provide the classes and methods required for image manipulation.

## Drawing Rectangles

Now, let's proceed with drawing rectangles on an image.

### Step 2: Create an Image

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";  // Set the path to your document directory
using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(dataDir, FileMode.Create))
{
    BmpOptions saveOptions = new BmpOptions();
    saveOptions.BitsPerPixel = 32;
    saveOptions.Source = new StreamSource(stream);

    using (Image image = Image.Create(saveOptions, 100, 100))
    {
        // Your code to draw rectangles will go here
        image.Save();
    }
}
```

In this step, we create an instance of the `Image` class and set various properties for image creation, such as the `BitsPerPixel` and the output stream. We then create a blank image of size 100x100 pixels.

### Step 3: Initialize Graphics and Draw Rectangles

```csharp
Graphics graphic = new Graphics(image);
graphic.Clear(Color.Yellow);
graphic.DrawRectangle(new Pen(Color.Red), new Rectangle(30, 10, 40, 80));
graphic.DrawRectangle(new Pen(new SolidBrush(Color.Blue)), new Rectangle(10, 30, 80, 40));
```

In this step, we initialize a `Graphics` object, clear the graphics surface with a yellow background, and draw two rectangles with different colors and positions on the image.

### Step 4: Save the Image

```csharp
image.Save();
```

Finally, we save the image with the drawn rectangles.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to draw rectangles on an image using Aspose.Imaging for .NET. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily create and manipulate images within your .NET applications. Aspose.Imaging simplifies image handling, making it a powerful tool for developers.

Now you're ready to incorporate image manipulation into your .NET projects using Aspose.Imaging. Start experimenting and creating stunning visuals!
